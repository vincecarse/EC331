\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces This graphic and the one following are taken from the Texas Tribune and provide a useful introduction to Texas' school finance system. Texas' school finance system is so politicised in Texas that it regularly makes state news, and legislative 'reform' is introduced each five or so years. This is due in large part to a multi-billion dollar property-tax-revenue redistribution program Texas has run each year since 1993/94.}}{3}{figure.1}\protected@file@percent }

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Twenty years after the SCOTUS decision, Texans successfully sued the Texan Commisioner of Education for discrimination against students in poor districts in Edgewood Independent School District v. Kirby (Tex 1989). The solution forged by the dispute between parents, lawmakers and judges which followed was finance-equalisation legislation passed in 1993. It is nicknamed \IeC {\textquoteleft }Robin Hood\IeC {\textquoteright }. In January 2019 Republican Governor Greg Abbott tweeted: "We must put Robin Hood school funding on a path of extinction", later congratulating himself (more mutedly) for "reform" on the issue as the 86th Legislative Session ended without Texas\IeC {\textquoteright } \$2b/year school redistribution scheme ending.}}{5}{figure.2}\protected@file@percent }
