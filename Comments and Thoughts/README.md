## New Features
 - Distance to nearest substitute school (ARCGIS)
     - Could need to use Google Maps API
 - District expenditure items (teacher pensions?)
 - Create charter subset


## Stuff to fix
- Check all data is actually from the correct/same year
- Use percent expenditures (e.g. for oil and gas) and then multiply that by per pupil to get per pupil oil and gas.

## General to do
- Delete unbalanced panel schools

## Thoughts
- Is there stuff on the 'type' of district/campus? Like urban, rural etc?
- Main code is called something like 'VAM'
